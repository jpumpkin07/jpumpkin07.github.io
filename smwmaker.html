      <p>Super Mario World Maker is a fangame I made in Scratch a few years ago, the whole idea of it is what Mario Maker would be like if it was made in the 90s for the SNES. You can make your own courses using 30 different blocks and enemies in the Level Editor, save and load them in Your Courses or play levels made by me in the Challenge Map.</p>

      <p>Controls are Z to run, X to jump, C to use spare items and the Arrow Keys to move. The mouse is also used for navigating menus and the level editor. Mario's collision engine is a bit buggy and you might get stuck in a wall if you run to fast, just hold left to get unstuck or click the Flag button to reset the game.</p>

      <p>You can find the original project page <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/399048563">here</a> or play it using the embed version below. It might take a while to load all the sprites and music so go grab a Vegemite sambo and watch some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8trRQreM_J0">DankPods</a> while you wait.</p>

      <p>All of the code in the project was written by me, jettypumpkin07. Sprites were taken from the Super Mario World and Super Mario Maker pages on The Spriters Resource, music and sounds from Zophar.net and The Sounds Resource. I do not take credit for Nintendo's work and it is licensed on Scratch under Fair Use.</p>
