      <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I usually work on small Minecraft servers and Discord bots, but there's some other stuff on here if you look hard enough. Most of the things I've made are listed on the <a href="https://jpumpkin07.github.io/projects">Projects</a> page, or consider joining <a href="https://jpumpkin07.github.io/curbit">CurbitCraft</a>, a modded SMP I've been running for a few months.</p>

      <p>Everything here is hand-written in HTML and CSS using tutorials from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html">W3Schools</a>, they're pretty good for learning stuff. You can see the code I wrote by right-clicking anywhere on the page and choosing "View page source".</p>

      <p>There isn't really anything useful on this site, I just got bored of normal programming one day and wanted to try something a little bit harder. You can check out some stuff I made on the <a href="https://jpumpkin07.github.io/projects">Projects</a> page, or consider joining <a href="https://jpumpkin07.github.io/curbit">CurbitCraft</a>, a modded SMP I've been running for a few months.</p>

      <p>Why are you here anyway? shouldn't you be feeding your cat <!-- that pisses on all your clothes and eats all your food instead of it's own -->or doing your homework or something?</br>
      Instead you're just sitting on your butt staring at millions of tiny lights that change 50-60 times a second...<br>Before you go, you should watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqwjC2NA5Dc">YouTube video</a> its the funniest thing ever lmao.</p>
      <p>Okay bye I guess.</p>
