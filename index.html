    i know almost nothing about html, more of a scratch and js guy so dont judge me
    there's way better stuff on my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/jettypumpkin07">scratch profile</a> than my github
    you're probably gonna bleach your eyeballs after seeing this raw website with no formatting or css
    most gh-pages sites use markdown but you have to use their stupid templates
    why are you here anyway? shouldnt you be doing your homework or something
    my school is nice and and only assigns homework when we dont finish the stuff we're supposed to do in class so i understand
    before you go, you should watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCzwyFHSMdY">youtube video</a> its the funniest thing ever lmao
    okay bye i guess.
