    <p>i know almost nothing about html, more of a scratch and js guy so dont judge me</p>
    <p>there's way better stuff on my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/jettypumpkin07">scratch account</a> than my github</p>
    <p>you're probably gonna bleach your eyeballs after seeing this raw website with no formatting or css</p>
    <p>why are you here anyway? shouldnt you be doing your homework or something</p>
    <p>my school is nice and and only assigns homework when we dont finish the stuff we're supposed to do in class so i understand</p>
    <p>before you go, you should watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCzwyFHSMdY">youtube video</a> its the funniest thing ever lmao</p>
