    <article>
      <p>I know almost nothing about HTML or CSS, more of a Python and JS guy so dont judge me if this looks like trash. Everything here is hand-written using documentation from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html">W3Schools</a>, they're pretty good for learning stuff. You can see the code I wrote by right-clicking anywhere on the page and choosing "View page source".</p>

      <p>There isn't really anything useful on this site, I just got bored of programming one day and wanted to try something a little bit harder. You can look at some stuff I drew on the <a href="https://jpumpkin07.github.io/art">art page</a> or the <a href="https://jpumpkin07.github.io/curbit">Minecraft SMP</a> I've been running for a few months.</p>

      <p>Why are you here anyway? shouldn't you be feeding your cat <!-- that pisses on all your clothes and eats all your food instead of it's own -->or doing your homework or something?</br>
      Instead you're just sitting on your butt staring at millions of tiny lights changing 50-60 times a second...</p>

      <p>before you go, you should watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aopMm7UGYA">youtube video</a> its the funniest thing ever lmao</p>
      <p>okay bye i guess.</p>
